Three is an attempt to ease systems and low-level programming that would typically be done with C.  Three's goals:

- Reduce macro usage
- Standardize conditional compilation
- Provide constructs for atomic and transaction memory operations
- Standardize and simply attributes
- Remove contentious coding style
- Simply commonly confused syntax
- Support vector and GPGPU coding
- Improve Unicode support
- Add Closures
- Add Namespacing
- Improve header management
- Improve and standardize linkage and ABI controls
- Standardize API documentation
